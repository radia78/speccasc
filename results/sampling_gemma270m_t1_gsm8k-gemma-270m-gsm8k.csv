In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
