"1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters. So he will run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters. He trained for a month which is 30 days. So in total he ran 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters. The answer is 180,000 meters.

These are just a few examples.

"40 roses a week is the amount Ford grows. Each week, he supplies 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. So he has 40 - 65 = -25 roses. The answer is -25.

So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
