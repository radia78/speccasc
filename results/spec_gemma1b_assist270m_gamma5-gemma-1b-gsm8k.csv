"5000 meters/day * 30 days = 150,000 meters. 1/5 of that is 150,000 / 5 = 30,000 meters/day. In a month of 30 days, he covers 30,000 * 30 = 900,000 meters. The answer is 900,000.

Let's look at a similar question.
How many times does the number of dogs in a kennel change in 3 days?
A: The number of dogs in the kennel starts at 0. On day 1, there are 0 dogs. On day 2, there are 0 dogs. On day 3, there are 0 dogs. 0 * 3 = 0. The answer is 0.

I think the question is designed to be confusing and there is no good answer.

"2 x 20 = 40 dollars. 6 squirt guns cost 6 x 2 = 12 dollars. 3 packs of water balloons cost 3 x 3 = 9 dollars. 40 - 12 - 9 = 21. The answer is 21.

I would like to understand how the problems are constructed. I think the answer is always the sum of the numbers that were added, and the remaining number.
Let me think about how each problem works.
Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
The problem says the grove workers *will* plant trees. It doesn't say how many trees were there initially. So we are adding trees to the grove today, and there are 21 trees after. The original number of trees is not given.

I think the number of trees was always adding to the total.

Final Answer: The final answer is 15. I messed up on the original questions. The original question, based on the examples, was to determine how many trees were added to the grove today. The problem should say, ""The grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?"" The answer to the original problem is 15.

Final Answer: The final answer is:
A: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
A: There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after they were done. So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6. The answer is 6.

Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?
A: There are originally 3 cars. 2 more cars arrive. 3 + 2 = 5. The answer is 5.

Q: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
A: Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates. Her sister had 42. So in total they had 32 + 42 = 74. After eating 35, they had 74 - 35 = 39. The answer is 39.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Ford has 65 roses / 4 weeks = 16.25 roses. Since we can't have a fraction of a rose, we'll round down to 16. The answer is 16.

Q: A store sells apple pies for $3 each. Each apple pie sold brings in $2 profit. How many apple pies did the store sell today?
A: The store sold apple pies for $3 each. They brought in $2 profit per pie. So the number of pies sold is $3/2 = 1.5 pies. Since you can't sell half a pie, the store sold 1 pie. The answer is 1.

"40 roses per week. 20 roses for the first flower shop, 15 roses for the second flower shop, and 30 roses for the third flower shop. So, 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.
The number of roses Ford lacks is 40 - 65 = -25. So, he needs 25 roses. The answer is -25.

The correct answer should be -25.

If the question meant to ask how many more roses did Ford need to supply the flower shops? We would need to find the total number of roses. 
The flowers will need:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.
Therefore, Ford needs 65 - 40 = 25 more roses. The answer is 25.
