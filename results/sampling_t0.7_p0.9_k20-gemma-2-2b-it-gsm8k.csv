"5000 meters is the distance Tyson runs daily. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more, which is 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters more. So he runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters in a day. If he runs this for a month, he runs 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters in a month. The answer is 180,000 meters.

Ford grows 40 roses per week. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second orders 15, and the third orders 30. So in total they order 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. Ford grows 40 roses per week. So he must supply 65 - 40 = 25 roses. The answer is 25.
