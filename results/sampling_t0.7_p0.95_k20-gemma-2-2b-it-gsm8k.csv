Let's use variables to solve this:

* Let 'x' represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.
* Four times the number of mugs is 4x.
* Eight more than four times the number is 4x + 8.
* The problem states that this is equal to 40, so: 4x + 8 = 40
* Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
* Divide both sides by 4: x = 8 

Therefore, there are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.
