"5000 meters/day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more, so he runs 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 extra meters every day. So his new distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.  He runs this distance every day for a month, which is 30 days. 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters. The answer is 180,000 meters.

"40 roses a week. First shop orders 20, second shop orders 15, third shop orders 30. Total roses for the week is 40 + 20 + 15 + 30 = 105.
