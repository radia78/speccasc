" Let's use algebra to solve this. Let ""x"" represent the number of coffee mugs.

* Four times the number of mugs is 4x.
* Eight more than four times the number is 4x + 8.
* We know this equals 40, so the equation is: 4x + 8 = 40

* Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
* Divide both sides by 4: x = 8


The answer is 8.
