"5000 meters is the distance Tyson runs everyday. If he runs 1/5 more meters, then he will run 5000 + (5000 * (1/5)) = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters a day. If he runs for a month, it will be 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters. The answer is 180,000.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The first shop needs 20 roses, the second needs 15, and the third needs 30. So, 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. Ford needs to supply 65 roses a week.

So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
