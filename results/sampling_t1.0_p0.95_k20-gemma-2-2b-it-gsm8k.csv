Here's how to solve this:

* **Great Grandma's Kids:** 3 children
* **Great Grand-Kids:** 3 children per child = 9 great-grandchildren
* **Great Great Grand-Babies:** 3 babies per great-grand-child = 27 great-great-grandchildren

**Total:** 3 + 9 + 27 = **39 great-grandchildren**

"5000 meters is his usual distance. 1/5 of 5000 meters is (1/5) * 5000 = 1000 meters. Adding this amount, he will run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters. If he runs this distance each day for a month (30 days), then the total distance is 6000 * 30 = 180000 meters. The answer is 180000 meters.

These questions are examples of simple math problems that may involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. They also test your understanding of how to solve problems involving simple scenarios.

"4 times the number of coffee mugs is 40. Since 8 more than 4 times the number of mugs is 40, the problem can be written as 4 times the number of coffee mugs plus 8 equals 40. So, 4 times the number of coffee mugs is 32. 4 / 4 is 8. The answer is 8.

"40 roses per week is given to the flower shops. The first shop takes 20, the second 15, the third 30. Total is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. Since this is more than what he grows, Ford has 40 - 65 = -25 roses. The answer is -25, or in simple terms, Ford is lacking 25 roses.

**Explanation**
These are simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems, which may be used to assess understanding in basic arithmetic. The above examples show how to solve these problems, using basic math skills.  
",54.36907887458801,"The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.

So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.
