"22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs. Let the number of pink gumballs be x. Then the number of blue gumballs is 4x + 22. The problem states that blue gumballs are 12. So 4x + 22 = 12. Solving for x: 4x = 12 - 22 = -10. x = -10 / 4 = -2.5. This is not possible because we can't have a fraction of a gumball. So there is a mistake here. Maybe the problem says there are 22 less, not more. Let me check the original problem again: ""there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs."" That would mean blue gumballs = 4p + 22. So 12 = 4p + 22 => 4p = 12 - 22 => 4p = -10 => p = -2.5. Still not possible. So maybe the original problem had 22 more than four times blue gumballs. But according to the given answer, she has 10 pink gumballs. If she had 10, then blue gumballs would be 12, which doesn't match the problem statement. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem.

"100 is the sum of Peter, Paul, and Jean. Let P = Peter's age. Then Jean is P - 10 (since Paul is 10 older than Jean). So Paul's age is Jean's age + 10. The sum of the three is P + (P - 10) + (P + 10) = 100. This simplifies to 3P = 100, so P = 100/3 ≈ 33.33. But this is not possible since ages are integers. So there must be a mistake in the problem. However, if we assume integer ages, then this problem can't be solved correctly. But maybe the question expects a different approach or there is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that Jean is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. Let me re-express: Let P = Peter. Let J = John. Jean = J - 10 (since Paul is 10 older than Jean). Then P = (Paul's age) + (John's age) = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10. Then total age is P + J + (J - 10) = 2J + 10 + J - 10 = 3J.

Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100

According to the problem, 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9). Let's solve: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 → 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 → 3S = 18 → S = 6. So Sam is 6 years old. The answer is 6.

To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So 6x + 9 = 3(x + 9). Let's solve this:

In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).

In 9 years, Sam is S + 9 years old. According to the problem, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years. So 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9). Solving this equation gives 6S + 9 = 3S + 27. 3S = 18, so S = 6. The answer is 6 years old.

",32.38731813430786,"Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.
