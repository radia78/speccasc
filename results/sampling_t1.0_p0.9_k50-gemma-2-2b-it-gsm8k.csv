Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Great Grandma's Children:** 3 children
* **Great Grandchildren:** 3 children per child = 9 grandchildren
* **Great Grandbabies:** 3 babies per grandchild = 27 great grandbabies

In total, there will be 3 + 9 + 27 = **39** great grandbabies.

"5000 meters is the distance Tyson runs every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which is 5000 * (1/5) = 1000 meters more each day. In a month, there are 30 days. So his total training distance is 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters.
