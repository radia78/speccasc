" Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Let ""x"" represent the number of coffee mugs.

* Four times the number of coffee mugs: 4x
* Eight more than four times the number: 4x + 8
* This expression equals 40: 4x + 8 = 40

Now, solve for x:

1. Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
2. Divide both sides by 4: x = 8


The answer is 8.
